fib(12)   # fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which we can add a two no an as a result we can get third no of the same sequence let us suppose
#adding the numbers 0+1=1 and add 1+1=2 and add 1+2=3 and add 2+3=5 and so on this making a sequence 1,2,3,5....so on

# fabonacci is applied on positive number if assign a negative number it give you the value of the given variable initial value here the initial value is (0) and (1)
